# NSFWSecurity
this mod is just a part of a system I created to help VRChat user to show their NSFW parts to only users that uses the mod or have followed the tutorial.

Explanation:

this avatar setup/mod is used to make you able to show some animation/object in your avatar to only the group of person you want, it's based on the new avatar dynamic mechanic, so, you can choose who can or cannot see your animation by allowing/disallowing interaction with them.
this system work with to parts:

-a part is only the "client" part, it is here to allow you to see the NSFW that a person authorizes you to see, if you don't have this part on your avatar, you won't be able to see the animations of the other person even if he authorizes you.
This is the part that my mod automates, so if you install my mod you don't need to modify your avatar to see the NSFW of those who allow you.

-the other part is the "provider" part, it is there to hide your chosen animations and wait for an authorized client to see the part.
<b>this part is not supported by my mod because it is too complex, to protect your NSFW you have to modify your avatar using the tutorial provided below !</b>

here's the tutorial that explain everything about this security and explain how to set it up on your avatar.

NOTE: you don't need to follow the first step if you install the mod, the mod only replicate the first step automatically to make every friends able to see your nsfw parts without setting up their avatar.
