# NSFWSecurity
this mod is just a part of a system I created to help VRChat user to show their NSFW parts to only users that uses the mod or have followed the tutorial.

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note that this mod/avatar setup work everywhere, but it is intended to be used only in private instances, so if you use it in public/friend+ instance, do it at your own risks, i'm not in any case responsible if you get caught/banned because you used it in friend+/public</span></strong></p>

Explanation:

the system is easy to understand... what if vrchat provided a NSFW marker that you can enable on certain parameter ? a marked parameter that will, in game, not be updated if you have not ticked a "allow nsfw" case in your safety settings.

that's what i'm trying to make with the avatar dynamics system, here's a github page with a full tutorial to setup your avatar with that security, there's also a melon loader mod in it that add a button in game to allow or disallow viewing nsfw.

this system work with to parts:

-a part is only the "client" part, it is here to allow you to see the NSFW that a person authorizes you to see, if you don't have this part on your avatar, you won't be able to see the animations of the other person even if he authorizes you.
This is the part that my mod automates, so if you install my mod you don't need to modify your avatar to see the NSFW of those who allow you.

-the other part is the "provider" part, it is there to hide your chosen animations and wait for an authorized client to see the part.
<b>this part is not supported by my mod because it is too complex, to protect your NSFW you have to modify your avatar using the tutorial provided below !</b>

here's the tutorial that explain everything about this security and explain how to set it up on your avatar.

NOTE: you don't need to follow the first step if you install the mod, the mod only replicate the first step automatically to make every friends able to see your nsfw parts without setting up their avatar.
